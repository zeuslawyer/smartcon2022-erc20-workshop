# TOKEN SHOP WITH CHAINLINK PRICE FEEDS

This project demonstrates

- the creation of a ERC20 token with Role Based Access Control.
- the use of Chainlink Price feeds to calculate the exchange rate of ETH/USD as the price of the ERC20 token is denominated in USD and the buyer account will send in ETH. So the ETH needs to be convered to USD to calculate how much of the ERC20 token needs to be minted for the buyer.
